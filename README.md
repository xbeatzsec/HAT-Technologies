  Your security HAT us</p>
  
  
The idea of creating this site was based on the theme of the work we have for the subject Human Resource Management, which consisted of creating a fictitious company
in our case the company "HAT Technologies", and present it.

The idea of HAT came from the initials of each of our names (H - Hernani, A - Alex, T - Tiago), also making a parallel with the definitions of the "types of hats" that each type of hacker represents in cybersecurity. Although Gray Hats are defined as, and transcribing from wikipedia, "computer security specialist who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker", in our view, we want to replace the idea of "...violating laws or ethical standards..." to proactive professionals, working not only for the client's request, but for their technological security, thus aligning the scales between challenge and of security.
